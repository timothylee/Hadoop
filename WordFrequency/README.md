# Sorted Word Frequency

This was another simple demonstration of mrjob with multiple steps.

The following command was run: !python WordFrequencySorted.py book.txt > sortedcount.txt

It finds the count of words using a regex split in the first step and then outputs the sorted list in the second step.
